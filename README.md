# dev-journey

-DAY 0-
 today, I took some first steps on my learning journey.
 I began by creating an edX account and enrolling in Harvardâ€™s CS50 course, which I plan to complete in order to build a solid foundation before diving deeper into fields like AI.
 I also watched some introductory tutorials on Git aswell as GitHub, set up my own GitHub account, and created this little "blog" to document my progress.
