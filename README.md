-DAY 0- 30/06/2025
 today, I took some first steps on my learning journey.
 I began by creating an edX account and enrolling in Harvard’s CS50 course, which I plan to complete in order to build a solid foundation before diving deeper into fields like AI.
 I also watched some introductory tutorials on Git aswell as GitHub, set up my own GitHub account, and created this little blog to document my progress.

-DAY 1- 01/07/2025
 today I completed Week 0 of CS50! 
 I watched the lecture and submitted my own Scratch project as the problem set, for which I created a small arcade-style minigame inspired by Pac-Man.
 It was a fun challenge although at times a bit frustrating, since Scratch definitely felt limiting in some ways, especially when I had specific mechanics or logic in mind. 
 Still, I managed to finish with something I'm fairly happy with, despite a few possibilities for improvement.
 
 I'm planning to revisit the project later in the course, maybe mid to late CS50 and then use what I’ve learned by then to improve or expand it a bit.
 I know I'm just getting started but I'm really enjoying the course so far. It's exciting, and I hope I can keep up the motivation and continue making good progress!

 During a little break today I also experimented with building a custom GPT that transforms CS50 lecture transcripts into structured notes. 
 It also offers support with lecture-related questions (but not with problem sets ofcourse because that would defeat the purpose) 
 Like my Scratch Project its also still very early and quite basic, but it was an interesting experiment nonetheless. I'm sure I'll work with this a bit more and maybe refine it in the future.

 My next few days are packed with work and plans with friends, so Ill probably continue with Week 1 on Friday. But I am Already very much looking forward to it!

-DAY 2- 04/07/2025
today I started and finished Week 1 of CS50. 
While the first exercises in this weeks problem set were fairly easy the final task "credit" really made me think for the first time and puzzle out a solution.
I really loved that, because that's  how I thin I learn best and that feeling of having to  work out and find a solution to a problem is what I love the most about coding.

At the beginning I also had to get used to the C syntax, but now after some exercises I already feel pretty comfortable with the basics. 
All in all I'm definitely excited to see how the course will progress from here  since it's been incredibly enjoyable so far.

Unfortunately I won’t be able to continue before next Monday, since I'm once again working twice over the weekend and also have plans with my girlfriend.
Monday itself is another workday too but I hope I can still squeeze in some time before or after work to get started with Week 2!
