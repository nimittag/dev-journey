-DAY 0- 30/06/2025
 today, I took some first steps on my learning journey.
 I began by creating an edX account and enrolling in Harvard’s CS50 course, which I plan to complete in order to build a solid foundation before diving deeper into fields like AI.
 I also watched some introductory tutorials on Git aswell as GitHub, set up my own GitHub account, and created this little blog to document my progress.

-DAY 1- 01/07/2025
 today I completed Week 0 of CS50! I watched the lecture and submitted my own Scratch project as the problem set, for which I created a small arcade-style minigame inspired by Pac-Man.
 It was a fun challenge although at times a bit frustrating, since Scratch definitely felt limiting in some ways, especially when I had specific mechanics or logic in mind. 
 Still, I managed to finish with something I'm fairly happy with, despite a few possibilities for improvement.
 
 I'm planning to revisit the project later in the course, maybe mid to late CS50 and then use what I’ve learned by then to improve or expand it a bit.
 I know I'm just getting started but I'm really enjoying the course so far. It's exciting, and I hope I can keep up the motivation and continue making good progress!

 During a little break today I also experimented with building a custom GPT that transforms CS50 lecture transcripts into structured notes. 
 It also offers support with lecture-related questions (but not with problem sets ofcourse because that would defeat the purpose) 
 Like my Scratch Project its also still very early and quite basic, but it was an interesting experiment nonetheless. I'm sure I'll work with this a bit more and maybe refine it in the future.

 My next few days are packed with work and plans with friends, so Ill probably continue with Week 1 on Friday. But I am Already very much looking forward to it!
